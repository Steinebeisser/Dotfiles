# Dotfiles

---

This repo contains the setup for my linux machiens. \
Im using [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io) as my dotfile manager

Currently no automated script to install packages/setup everything, therefore here a list of needed packages

---

## packages

```
kitty
neovim
zsh
waybar
hyprland

maybe more
```

---

## How to run

```
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/Steinebeisser/Dotfiles.git
```

After that rejoin or reboot for everything to apply correctly
